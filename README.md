This tool is fully frontend-driven. A streamlit dashboard interacts with a python engine and a database in the backend. Please start by installing the contents of requirements.txt in a virtual environment. The approach to launch the tool is simply going to a command line, navigating to the project root folder, and typing:

streamlit run ./dashboard/Getting_Started.py
